# contacts-backend

There is an issue with the postgres as it doesn't load properly, this could be due to my .env link being wrong or something else. I will have to do more research to find it out.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
