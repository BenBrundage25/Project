Requirements: Made for use on a Unix system such as Cygwin or Linux 

Description: This is a program that I made so I could learn more about project making and has changed into a learning program for important app making with tools like react, hono, bun, postgres, and zod.

Usage: this program is meant to store contact information for as many contacts as you would like. Made so I could learn how to keep information on a local file for future use.

Storage: The .dat file generated during your first runtime will locally store information about the people that you put into it.

How to Use: To use the code, simply go to the file location, and input the g++ compiler as shown below

     To compile:
        g++ -Wall -o Contact Contact.cpp
     
     To run:
        ./Contact.exe

     To remove the resulting exe files:
        rm *.exe
